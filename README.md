# SteamKey.Trade

SteamKey.Trade is a community-driven platform where gamers can safely and easily trade their Steam keys, built by [admiring open-source contributors](https://github.com/Revadike/SteamKey.Trade/graphs/contributors) and gamers alike.

## Requirements

- **[Node.js v20](https://nodejs.org/)** – A JavaScript runtime with improved security and performance.
- **[Docker](https://www.docker.com/)** – A platform for containerized application deployment.
- **[Deno](https://deno.com/)** - A open-source JavaScript runtime for the modern web.

## Instructions

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Revadike/SteamKey.Trade.git
   cd SteamKey.Trade
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the Supabase stack:**
   ```bash
   npm run supabase:start
   ```

4. **Set up environment local variables:**
   Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and run:
     ```bash
     npx supabase status
     ```
   Enter the API_URL as `SUPABASE_URL` and anon key as `SUPABASE_KEY`.
   
   Inside the supabase folder, copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and enter the environment variables.

5. **(Optional) Set up environment production variables:**
   Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and enter the URL and API key from [here](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/api).
   
   Inside the supabase folder, copy `.env.example` to `.env.prod` and enter the environment variables.

6. **(Optional) Supabase login:**
   ```bash
   npx supabase login
   ```

7. **(Optional) Supabase link:**
   ```bash
   npx supabase link
   ```

8. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Database
Changes to the database are tracked through migration files, located in `supabase/migrations`. Best to do this in a local environment first, before pushing to production. There are three ways to make new migrations:

1. **(Recommended) Edit Schema Definitions:**

   You can edit the [declarative database schemas](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/local-development/declarative-database-schemas) located in `supabase/schemas`. You can alter and test the schema definitions (including RLS and triggers), and if you're happy with the change, you can generate a new migration using `supabase stop && supabase db diff -s public -f my_change` (replace `my_change` with a name describing the change), or [supabase:diff](#npm-scripts). *Always review your generated migration files for correctness.*
   
3. **Via Studio:**

   If you like to avoid writing raw SQL for migrations, this is the way for you. Make changes to your local database via the [Supabase studio](http://localhost:54323). Then simply run the [supabase:pull](#npm-scripts) command to generate new migrations based on your changes. *Always review your generated migration files for correctness.* Make sure to update the `supabase/schemas` files with the changes you made in the studio.

5. **Manually:**

   If you rather want to write your own migration files, start with `npx supabase migration new my_change` (replace `my_change` with a name describing the change). This will generate a new empty migration in `supabase/migrations/<timestamp>_my_change.sql`. In here, you can write in SQL the changes you wish to apply to the database. Once done, test them by applying these changes to your local database via [supabase:push](#npm-scripts). Make sure to update the `supabase/schemas` files with the changes you made in the migration.

### Functions
Supabase has so-called Edge functions, which are serverside functions developed with Deno. To create a new function, create `index.js` in `supabase/functions/my-function/` (replace `my-function` with the name of your function). In here, you can write your Deno code. Find more information on how to write these functions [here](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/functions). Finally, add the function to `supabase/config.toml`: 
```toml
[functions.my-function]
# verify_jwt = false # Skip JWT verification
entrypoint = './functions/my-function/index.js'
```
